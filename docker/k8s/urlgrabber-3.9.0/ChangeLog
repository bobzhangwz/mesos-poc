	* makefile: add a few more things to be cleaned out

2009-07-31  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* ChangeLog: update changelog

2009-07-31  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: - make readlines() work for mirrorlists in yum (which probably
	shouldn't be using it anyway) - do a do_grab() in _do_open() which
	may or may not be a good idea - I could also make the _do_grab()
	happen when someone attempts to hit a method beyond the file object
	open

2009-07-30  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: - make basic posts work

2009-07-30  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* maint/git2cl: add git2cl

2009-07-30  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: when I first started this I hacked
	something into URLGrabberFileObject - this reverts that hack

2009-07-30  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* ChangeLog, maint/cvs2cl.pl, maint/usermap, test/runtests.py,
	urlgrabber/__init__.py: - clean up some unused files - update the changelog - bump the
	version - update the copyright in a couple of places

2009-07-30  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* MANIFEST.in, makefile: - make makefile work again without using cvs - add makefile to
	MANIFEST.in

2009-07-30  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: - make simple/most proxies work - remove unnnecessary 'have_range'
	check for pycyurl obj

2009-07-29  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: - add range support - get rid of the .part file thing - it makes
	range-regets harder than they need to be - make sure regets behave

2009-07-29  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: implement throttle/bandwidth controls in
	pycurl tested with the progress call back - seems to work very well


2009-07-29  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: get the content-length/size for ftp pkgs
	too - steals parse150 from ftplib. Should work for A LOT of ftp
	servers, but not all of them - add self.scheme for which protocol
	we're using here.

2009-07-29  James Antill <james@and.org>

	* urlgrabber/byterange.py: Import fix for ftp ports in old urilib
	code (probably worthless now, but meh)

2009-07-29  James Antill <james@and.org>

	* urlgrabber/progress.py: Import progress patches from Fedora.
	These were done over a couple of years:    . cleanup UI.   . dynamic
	terminal widths.     . deal with serial console.   . total download
	stuff.

2009-07-28  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* test/runtests.py, urlgrabber/grabber.py: implement
	PyCurlFileObject. This makes the default and forklifts all the code
	to pycurl. This is not finished but is functional for a significant
	number of the tests. things known to be broken: - proxies - http
	POST - non-header-based byte-ranges - certain types of read
	operations when downloading a file to memory instead of to a
	filename

2009-05-15  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: make it use *args instead of silly if
	statements

2009-05-15  Seth Vidal <skvidal@fedoraproject.org>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: modify urlgraberror so it has a url
	attribute and includes the url in all error messages.

2006-12-12  mstenner <mstenner>

	* urlgrabber/grabber.py: more debugging code to expose options

2006-12-08  mstenner <mstenner>

	* scripts/urlgrabber, test/test_grabber.py, urlgrabber/grabber.py,
	urlgrabber/keepalive.py: lots of changes... improved clarity of
	cached objects, improved debugging and logging, more options to the
	urlgrabber script.

2006-12-07  mstenner <mstenner>

	* scripts/urlgrabber, urlgrabber/grabber.py: Minor doc updates and
	error handling in grabber.py.  Complete rewrite of the urlgrabber
	script.

2006-12-05  mstenner <mstenner>

	* Minor fix to make byteranges work with some servers.  _do_grab now
	only reads as much as it needs to, rather than reading until the
	server sends EOF.
